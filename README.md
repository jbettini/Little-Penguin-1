# Little Penguin - Linux Kernel Development

This repository contains my solutions for the "Little Penguin - Linux Kernel Development" project. All tasks were completed on my own Linux From Scratch (LFS) distribution.

## About the Project

The "Little Penguin" project is a series of practical assignments designed to explore Linux kernel development. It covers various topics, such as compiling a custom kernel, writing kernel modules, managing devices, and more.

## Development Environment

I completed this project on my Linux From Scratch (LFS) distribution, adhering strictly to the project requirements and guidelines. This setup allowed for a thorough understanding and hands-on experience with kernel development and customization.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this project, you will need:

-   An LFS (Linux From Scratch) installation or another Linux distribution: You need a working Linux environment to compile and test the kernel.
-   Kernel development tools such as gcc, make, and git: These tools are required to compile the kernel and work with the source code. Ensure you also have gpg for signing commits and verifying patches.
-   Access to the Linux kernel sources (obtained from git.kernel.org): You will need to download the source code of the kernel you want to compile or modify.
-   usbutils: Make sure to have usbutils installed, a set of tools to manage and query USB devices on your system.

## Instructions

-   Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/jbettini/Little-Penguin-1.git
cd Little-Penguin-1
```
## Assignments

The project consists of several assignments, each focusing on different aspects of kernel development. For detailed explanations and methods for completing each assignment, consult the [wiki](https://github.com/jbettini/Little-Penguin-1/wiki).
