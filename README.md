# Little Penguin - Linux Kernel Development

This repository contains my solutions for the "Little Penguin - Linux Kernel Development" project. All tasks were completed on my own Linux From Scratch (LFS) distribution.

## About the Project

The "Little Penguin" project is a series of practical assignments designed to explore Linux kernel development. It covers various topics, such as compiling a custom kernel, writing kernel modules, managing devices, and more.

## Development Environment

I completed this project on my Linux From Scratch (LFS) distribution, adhering strictly to the project requirements and guidelines. This setup allowed for a thorough understanding and hands-on experience with kernel development and customization.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this project, you will need:

-    An LFS installation or another Linux distribution
-    Kernel development tools such as gcc, make, and git. Ensure you have gpg for signing commits and verifying patches.
-    Access to the Linux kernel sources (obtained from git.kernel.org)

## Instructions

-   Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/jbettini/Little-Penguin-1.git
cd Little-Penguin-1
```
## Assignments
