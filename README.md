# Little Penguin - Linux Kernel Development

This repository contains my solutions for the "Little Penguin - Linux Kernel Development" project. All tasks were completed on my own Linux From Scratch (LFS) distribution.

## About the Project

The "Little Penguin" project is a series of practical assignments designed to explore Linux kernel development. It covers various topics, such as compiling a custom kernel, writing kernel modules, managing devices, and more.

## Development Environment

I completed this project on my Linux From Scratch (LFS) distribution, which allowed me to learn how each component of the system interacts directly with the kernel. This approach provided greater control and a deeper understanding of the project's tasks.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this project, you will need:

-    An LFS installation or another Linux distribution
-    Kernel development tools such as gcc, make, and git
-    Access to the Linux kernel sources (obtained from git.kernel.org)

## Instructions

-   Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/jbettini/Little-Penguin-1.git
cd Little-Penguin-1
```
## Assignments

The project consists of several assignments, each focusing on different aspects of kernel development. For detailed explanations and methods for completing each assignment, consult the [wiki](https://github.com/jbettini/Little-Penguin-1/wiki).
